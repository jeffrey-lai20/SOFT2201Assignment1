This project consists of the construction of a platformer video game.
A hero is created that is able to move left, right and jump on some floor,
and clouds blow in the sky.

In order to run the game, ensure Java 11 and Gradle is installed and functioning.
For a Linux operating system, in the CLI (command-line interface) type in: 

	$gradle build

Afterwards run the game by typing:

	$gradle run

If Java 11 and/or Gradle is not installed, it is accessable through

environment:
